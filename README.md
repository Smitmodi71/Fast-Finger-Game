Project for CS 120B 
# Overview: 
This is a simple game called “fast finger” I have created. User follows the onscreen instructions and depending on which level he chooses (Easy or hard) he will get the random number that will tell how many points the user needs to score in order to win the game. Winner of the game will be decided on how fast one can press the button 
to score many points.
